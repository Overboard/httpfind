Features:
    ☐ Support networks larger than 256 addresses
    ☐ Support filtering against headers
    ☐ Support IPv6
    ☐ Parameterize connection timeout

Issues:
    ☐ 1 - Cannot evaluate device that replies with 401 (use headers instead?)
    ☐ 2 - No means to close event loop.  Consider optional context manager.

Testing:
    ☐ Decide if unit tests are useful
    ☐ Add tests
